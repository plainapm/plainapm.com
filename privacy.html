    <p>PlainAPM helps customers understanding changes in their Rails application’s performance, by gathering and analysing application metrics on the PlainAPM platform. Your privacy and the protection of your personal data is of great importance to us. During the processing of your personal data both offline and via our website (plainapm.com) and platform we work in accordance with the requirements for the processing of personal data laid down in the privacy legislation, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This means we:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clearly specify our purposes before we process personal data, by using this privacy and cookie policy.</li>
  <li>Limit our collection of personal data to only the personal data needed for legitimate purposes.</li>
  <li>First ask for explicit permission to process your personal data in cases where your permission is required.</li>
  <li>Take appropriate security measures to protect your personal data and we demand the same from parties who process personal data on our behalf.</li>
  <li>Respect your right to access, correct or delete your personal data held by us.</li>
</ul>

<p>This privacy and cookie policy applies to the processing of data for which
PlainAPM is responsible. This is the case for the data PlainAPM collects from
you, when you visit the website or when you use our services as a SaaS

and cookie policy of the relevant SaaS business if you have any questions about
the handling of your personal data.</p>
