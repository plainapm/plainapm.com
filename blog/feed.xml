a quick summary:</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h2>

<p>Yeah, the least visible, yet probably the most important. PlainAPM is
now hosted on a new infrastructure, which means things are faster and
more scalable.</p>

<h2 id="cpu-time--gc-stats-tracking">CPU time &amp; GC stats tracking</h2>

<p>The agent now collects per-thread time spent on the CPU, and also GC
stats - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gc_time</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gc_major</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gc_minor</code> counts.</p>

<p>This allows e.g. searching for jobs or requests that were affected by
long GC pauses:</p>

if youâ€™d like to try it out for your app.</p>

<h2 id="ui-tweaks">UI tweaks</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking of search, the search results have been streamlined, so they
show only the most important attributes &amp; metrics by default, with the
full view being accessible by clicking on an â€˜expandâ€™ button.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apps view displays aggregated stats/estimated costs for the current
month, giving a quick overview of the current appâ€™s status.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The UI remembers the last page visited, and logging in/opening the app
automatically redirects there, so it is possible to continue from where
you left off.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Requests/jobs tables show a relative % time spent in a given
transaction, which makes it easy to spot current heavy-hitters:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed their feedback!</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">Whatâ€™s next</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>PII filtering. While the agent currently depends on the instrumented appâ€™s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rails.application.config.filter_parameters</code> <a href="https://plainapm.com/docs#filtering-sensitive-information">settings</a>,
this isnâ€™t 100% dependable. It also relies on the developer
configuring - mostly adding - extra filters to scrub PII and other
sensitive data from attributes and queries. A PII filter would make
it less likely for that data to ever hit the database.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improved span context passing across Process/Thread/Fibers
boundaries. And, as there are <a href="https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/trace-context#legacy-http-header">different</a> <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-request-id">conventions</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/">standards</a> when it comes to
passing the trace context across systems, we should pick &amp; support
the most widely accepted one(s), for better future interoperability.</p>
  </li>

<p>Iâ€™ve been quietly building PlainAPM as a side project, and since Iâ€™m really
happy how things are going, I think itâ€™s time for the next step.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Iâ€™m looking for early users to partner with and, based on your feedback,
shape PlainAPMâ€™s future.</p>

<p>Interested? Please make sure youâ€™re signed up on the <a href="https://cdn.forms-content.sg-form.com/5582cfbc-74a9-11ed-a388-825cdbd151cb">beta list</a>,
and lets have a chat - we can get your app connected and Iâ€™m ready to
answer any questions, pair together, and provide help and support.</p>

<p>I know your time is valuable, so Iâ€™m happy to send you some swag and
give a discount to your first bills - and, if we meet in person, your
favourite beverage is on me â˜•.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll be also posting more about why I decided to build PlainAPM, and
stuff that you can do with it - stay tuned!</p>]]></content><author><name>BalÃ¡zs</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="hello-world" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlainAPM goes live]]></summary></entry></feed>
